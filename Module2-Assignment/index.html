    <h1>Three Basic Keys To Success</h1>

                <h2>1. Work</h2>
                <p>
                    “Success is simply a matter of luck. Ask any failure.” <br>
                    All failures know that success is simply a matter of luck, they know it’s just a matter of being at the right place at the right time, they know with assurance that success is directly linked to good ole fashion chance.
                    However, those who have succeeded know that success is directly and proportionally linked to work.  Even an amazing strategy can’t guarantee success.  Zig Ziglar said, “The most practical, beautiful, workable philosophy in the world won’t work – if you won’t.”

                <h2>2. Confidence</h2>
                <p>
                    “Confidence is the companion of success.” <br>
                    If you don’t believe in your abilities, don’t be surprised if no one else does either.  Your negative thoughts about yourself send a signal throughout the world that others pick up on and respond accordingly.  If you’re broadcasting the station “Depression 108.7” then others will treat you like you’re depressed.
                    But, when you believe in yourself and your potential, people pick up that signal, and they will treat you according to how they believe, you believe, you should be treated.  Did you get that?

                <h2>3. Lead</h2>
                <p>
                    “A most important key to successful leadership is your ability to direct and challenge the very best that is in those whom you lead.” <br>
                    To be successful you must be a great leader.  There’s probably nothing more difficult than being a great leader.  It’s easy to be selfish, it’s easy to only be concerned with your needs, your wants and your desires.  But to succeed you have to lead!  You have to do what’s best for the people; you must bring the best out of those in whom you lead.
